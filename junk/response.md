Here's their exchange about former President Joe Biden's mental and physical capabilities:\n\nX Post Loading...\n\nThings didn't get any easier for Moran when the focus of the interview turned to the ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine:\n\n![](https://media.notthebee.com/ads/Ads-67f562c0181cd67f562c0181ce.png)\n\nX Post Loading...\n\nWhen he was asked about his confidence in Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Trump quickly returned fire:\n\nX Post Loading...\n\n> I don't have a hundred percent confidence that we're going to finish this interview.\n\n# ðŸ’€\n\nMoran also tried to attack Trump about government cuts and Trump called out his faux journalism:\n\nX Post Loading...\n\nPerhaps the wildest moment of the interview was the argument over the deported \"Maryland dad,\" AKA Salvadoran gangster Kilgar Garcia, who entered the country illegally:\n\nX Post Loading...\n\nMoran knows that the entire picture wasn't photoshopped. The Trump admin added the letters \"MS-13\" on Garcia's knuckles to indicate the meaning of tattoos, along with labels for the symbols (Marijuana, Smile, Cross, Skull).\n\nX Post Loading...\n\nThe only reason Moran would twist the truth is because he wants to **influence** the American public rather than **inform** them (this is called activism).\n\n### A quick word of advice for ABC News: If you're going to send someone to go toe-to-toe with Trump, pick a heavy hitter, not some scrub.\n\n![](https://media.notthebee.com/ads/Ads-67f562eeb163b67f562eeb163c.png)\n\n* * *\n\nP.S.
