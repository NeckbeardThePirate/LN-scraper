Now it's evidence in her deportation case\n\nLeft\n\nCenter\n\nRight\nBias Comparison\n\nBias Comparison\n\n- In March 2024, a four-page internal report regarding the arrest of Palestinian protester Leqaa Kordia was compiled by an [NYPD](https://ground.news/interest/nypd) officer and subsequently shared with federal immigration officials.\n- This sharing followed a federal request related to a criminal investigation despite sanctuary laws generally prohibiting police cooperation with immigration enforcement.\n- Kordia, a 32-year-old New Jersey resident originally from Jerusalem, was detained after a voluntary immigration check-in and charged with disorderly conduct at a Columbia University protest opposing Israel’s Gaza campaign.\n- The Trump administration cited her expired visa and participation in pro-Hamas protests to justify deportation, while Kordia’s attorney said the government’s case relies on a single protest summons and no violent acts were found by a judge.\n- The case sparks debate about NYPD’s compliance with sanctuary laws and broader concerns over government targeting of political speech and noncitizen rights amid information-sharing practices between city and federal agencies.\n\nInsights by Ground AI\n\nDoes this summary seem wrong?\n\nShare menu\n\n## 34 Articles\n\n## 34 Articles\n\nAll\n\nLeft\n\n12\n\nCenter\n\n12\n\nRight\n\n4\n\n[![NY1](https://ground.news/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgroundnews.b-cdn.net%2Finterests%2Fb607521bc457a182e745b602a4281e4bd3ddc2c4.jpg%3Fwidth%3D24&w=64&q=75)NY1](https://ground.news/interest/ny1com)\n\n[Center](https://ground.news/interest/ny1com#bias-ratings)\nFactuality\n\nOwnership\n\n[**NYPD shared a protester's info with ICE.
