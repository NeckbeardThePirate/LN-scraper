Trump puts key climate report in doubt\n\nLeft\n\nCenter\n\nRight\nBias Comparison\n\nBias Comparison\n\n- In early May 2025, two leading scientific organizations announced plans to collaboratively produce peer-reviewed studies evaluating how [climate change](https://ground.news/interest/climate-change) is affecting the United States.\n- This initiative is a response to the Trump administration’s recent decision to release approximately 400 scientists involved in producing the federally mandated National Climate Assessment report scheduled for completion around 2027.\n- The societies' collaboration aims to fill a gap in scientific process by providing current and future projections of climate change effects up to 25 and 100 years ahead.\n- AGU President Brandon Jones said, \"We are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\" while climate scientist Donald Wuebbles warned the new administration might issue a scientifically based but \"pretty crappy\" document.\n- Their work symbolizes the scientific community's statement that climate change remains urgent and that suppressing the federal report will not stop awareness of its impacts.\n\nInsights by Ground
