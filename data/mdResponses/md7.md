Bias Comparison

- Governor [Greg Abbott](https://ground.news/interest/greg-abbott) is scheduled to sign Senate Bill 2 on Saturday in Texas, establishing a $1 billion program that provides Education Savings Accounts to support school vouchers.
- The program follows years of conservative efforts and recent political shifts, including primary challenges that secured pro-voucher Republicans.
- The law allows all 5.3 million Texas public school students to apply for ESAs offering about 85% of their district’s average per-student funding around $10,000.
- Advocates say the program prioritizes low-income and special needs families with up to $30,000 for those students, while opponents warn it diverts funds from public schools.
- The vouchers are expected to launch in the 2026-27 school year, suggesting a significant shift in Texas education funding and parental school choice options.
