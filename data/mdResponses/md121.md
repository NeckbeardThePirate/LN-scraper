Bias Comparison

- On April 9, 2025, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs unveiled a week earlier, excluding those on China, easing market tensions.
- This pause followed fears raised by steep tariffs announced on April 2 that caused a rapid 12% [S&P 500](https://ground.news/interest/s-and-p-500) drop and nearly 4,600-point Dow loss.
- The announcement, made on social media, aimed to negotiate tariffs with trading partners and push companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S., goals that conflicted.
- The S&P 500 surged 9.5%, recording one of its best days, while the Treasury secretary cited U.S.-China de-escalation, and Trump stated bond investors were "getting a little queasy."
- Despite strong profits and job growth supporting markets, uncertainty about tariffs' lasting impact persists, with experts warning stocks could fall again after the pause expires in July.
