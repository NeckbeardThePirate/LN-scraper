Bias Comparison

- On May 4, 2024, [Warren Buffett](https://ground.news/interest/warren-buffett), aged 94, announced at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in Omaha that he plans to retire by year-end and recommend Greg Abel as CEO.
- This decision follows Buffett's 60-year leadership and his prior statement of no retirement plans, amid concerns about succession and a volatile trade environment under President Trump.
- Buffett praised Abel’s proven management and predicted Abel might be more hands-on while respecting managers' autonomy, as Berkshire’s diverse businesses largely operate independently.
- Buffett warned that tariffs risk global instability, stating ‘‘trade should not be a weapon’’ and noting ‘‘there's no question that trade can be an act of war’’ affecting 7.5 billion people worldwide.
- Despite recent market turmoil, Buffett remains optimistic, stating Berkshire holds $347.7 billion in cash and expects future investment opportunities, while shareholders express confidence in the company's stability post-retirement.
