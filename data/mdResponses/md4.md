Bias Comparison

- American employers added 177,000 jobs in April 2025, exceeding economists' forecast of 135,000 and marking continued job market resilience.
- This growth occurred despite trade tensions from President Trump's tariffs, a recent revision that lowered March hiring to 185,000, and labor market uncertainties.
- Healthcare firms added nearly 51,000 jobs, transportation 29,000, bars and restaurants 17,000, and construction 11,000, while labor force participation edged up slightly.
- Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% from March and 3.8% annually, with [unemployment](https://ground.news/interest/unemployment) steady at 4.2%, although consumer confidence dropped to pandemic-era lows.
- Economists caution that steep tariffs, federal workforce cuts, and immigration slowdowns could slow job growth and raise the 2025 unemployment rate toward 5%.
