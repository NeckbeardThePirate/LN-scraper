Bias Comparison

- In March 2024, a four-page internal report regarding the arrest of Palestinian protester Leqaa Kordia was compiled by an [NYPD](https://ground.news/interest/nypd) officer and subsequently shared with federal immigration officials.
- This sharing followed a federal request related to a criminal investigation despite sanctuary laws generally prohibiting police cooperation with immigration enforcement.
- Kordia, a 32-year-old New Jersey resident originally from Jerusalem, was detained after a voluntary immigration check-in and charged with disorderly conduct at a Columbia University protest opposing Israel’s Gaza campaign.
- The Trump administration cited her expired visa and participation in pro-Hamas protests to justify deportation, while Kordia’s attorney said the government’s case relies on a single protest summons and no violent acts were found by a judge.
- The case sparks debate about NYPD’s compliance with sanctuary laws and broader concerns over government targeting of political speech and noncitizen rights amid information-sharing practices between city and federal agencies.
