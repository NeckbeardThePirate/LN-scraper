Bias Comparison

- On May 3, 2025, [Wall Street](https://ground.news/interest/wall-street) extended its winning streak to nine days in a row, achieving its longest series of consecutive gains in over two decades in New York.
- This rally followed President Trump's early April trade war escalation and the pending expiration of a 90-day tariff pause in July, raising market uncertainty.
- The stock market rally was supported by better-than-expected April job gains of 177,000, broad sector advances, and hopes for easing U.S.-China trade tensions.
- The Dow rose 1.4%, Nasdaq climbed 1.5%, 90% of S&P 500 stocks advanced, and the 10-year Treasury yield increased to 4.31% amid positive economic indicators.
- Despite the rally, concerns remain that if tariffs resume in July, markets could face volatility similar to April, and the economy shows signs of stress with a 0.3% Q1 contraction.
